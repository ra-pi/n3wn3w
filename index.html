        Founded in 2018, Razo Group of Companies began with a simple but meaningful goal: to build businesses that create real opportunities for 
        people and contribute positively to the community. Headquartered in General Santos City, Philippines, and with growing operations in Canada, 
        the Group has steadily expanded into various industries through dedication, hard work, and a clear long-term vision.
        What started as a focused initiative has grown into a diversified organization operating in dairy farming, agriculture, food production, real 
        estate, education and training, international workforce support, security services, and garden development. Each business under the Group was 
        established with purpose not only to operate successfully, but to create jobs, develop skills, and strengthen partnerships locally and abroad.
        At the heart of Razo Group is a commitment to quality, integrity, and sustainable growth. The organization believes that business success should 
        go hand in hand with community development and opportunity-building.
